/**
 * MENTOR adapter — the sixth commander, and the one that inverts the engine.
 *
 * The other five resolve an incident by *changing something*: SENTINEL patches
 * source, LEDGER rightsizes a cluster, VERDICT rewrites clauses. MENTOR's whole
 * product thesis is that it must **not** (`MENTOR-CONCEPT.md` §2 — "the tool that
 * refuses to hand you the patch"). Running that on an engine whose only
 * successful exit is `deploy()` needs the lifecycle re-read rather than rewritten:
 *
 * | Engine concept  | MENTOR's meaning                                                |
 * |-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | the "fix"       | the causal explanation, not a code change                       |
 * | `verifyTool`    | `check_grounding` — is the drift claim grounded in both artifacts? |
 * | `mutationTools` | `load_plan` / `load_build` — new inputs invalidate the grounding |
 * | `submitTool`    | emit the explanation                                            |
 * | `deploy()`      | hand the explanation to the student. Touches no code.           |
 * | `awaitRecovery` | assert the student's source is **byte-identical** — prove we didn't fix it |
 * | `blastRadius`   | inverted: confidence in the origin claim                        |
 *
 * Two of those are worth reading twice.
 *
 * **`awaitRecovery` is the refusal, enforced.** In every other commander it asks
 * "did the system come back up?" Here there is nothing to come back up, so it
 * asks the question that actually matters for this domain: *is the student's code
 * exactly as they left it?* If MENTOR ever modified the build, that check fails
 * and the incident ESCALATES. The refusal is a runtime invariant, not a promise.
 *
 * **`blastRadius` is inverted.** For SENTINEL, risk is how much code changed.
 * MENTOR changes none — but it is about to point a student at a specific line, and
 * §10 is explicit that a confidently wrong line is worse than useless in
 * education. So the risk *is* the claim's uncertainty. Feeding drift confidence
 * here means an ambiguous plan drives the gate below threshold and pauses for a
 * human instead of misleading a student.
 *
 * There is deliberately no tool on this adapter that can write to the build. The
 * refusal is structural: `executeTool` has no such case to reach.
