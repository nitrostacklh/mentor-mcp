/**
 * MENTOR · Education — the MCP surface for the sixth commander.
 *
 * `explain_drift` is the submission's headline tool. It takes the student's plan
 * and build history as *optional* arguments and falls back to the bundled pricing
 * fixture, which is what lets the stage demo be one click with nothing to upload
 * while the same tool still serves a real project (`GAPS.md` Gap 6).
 *
 * `withhold_fix` exists so the refusal is a tool call a judge can point at rather
 * than prose in a system prompt.
