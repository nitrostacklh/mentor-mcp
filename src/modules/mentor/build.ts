/**
 * The BUILD half of MENTOR's input — `mentor.build/v1`.
 *
 * What the student *actually did*, in order. The counterpart to `plan.ts`: the
 * plan says what they meant, this says what happened, and the diff between the
 * two is the whole product.
 *
 * The field that carries the weight is `seq` — the order work was done — because
 * MENTOR's claim is about *when*, not *what*. `file` + `line` per step is what
 * turns "you built tax too early" into "you built tax too early, on line 12".
 *
 * ## Provenance is part of the contract, not metadata
 *
 * `provenance` records whether this history was **derived** from a real git
 * history or **authored** by hand. It is not decoration: it feeds the confidence
 * score directly (`drift.ts`). An authored history is a claim about the past that
 * nobody observed, and MENTOR advertising "it has a time axis"
 * (`MENTOR-CONCEPT.md` §5) while silently trusting a hand-written timeline would
 * be the exact overclaim AEGIS flags in other people's output.
 *
 * The demo fixture is `authored`, which is why it scores 0.91 rather than ~0.97.
 * Building the git deriver (`GAPS.md` Gap 5) raises the score honestly.
