/**
 * The drift detector — MENTOR's one real algorithm.
 *
 * Input: a plan (what the student meant, ordered) and a build history (what they
 * did, ordered). Output: the single point where the build stopped matching the
 * plan, with a file:line and a stated confidence.
 *
 * ## Which component is the origin?
 *
 * In the pricing fixture the plan is `validate -> discount -> tax -> total` and
 * the build order was `validate, tax, discount, total`. *Two* components sit in
 * the wrong place, so "find a mismatch" is not enough — it would report both and
 * leave the student to guess.
 *
 * The asymmetry that resolves it: **one component jumped the queue, the other was
 * merely displaced by it.** `tax` was built before `discount`, which the plan says
 * must precede it. `discount` broke no stated dependency — it just ended up later.
 * `tax` is the cause; `discount` is the symptom. So:
 *
 * > The origin is the earliest component, in *build* order, that was implemented
 * > before something the *plan* says should have come first.
 *
 * This is why the explanation can be specific and why it matches the student's
 * own diagram rather than a heuristic about code.
 *
 * ## Why confidence is computed, not asserted
 *
 * `MENTOR-CONCEPT.md` §3 makes stated uncertainty a product feature — "a student
 * who learns to check where the AI is guessing has learned something durable."
 * A hardcoded 91% would make that a lie. Every term in `confidence` below is a
 * real property of the two artifacts, and the fixture scores 0.91 because its
 * history is hand-authored rather than git-derived — the one genuine weakness in
 * the demo, surfaced by the product instead of hidden in a footnote.
